Uploading dashboards to Tableau Public is a little different from uploading to server. After entering your login details, you can specify the name of your project if you chose the option to "save to Tableau Public as". However, the options you have when you upload to Tableau Server are not displayed at this point, including the option to "Show sheets as tabs".

In order to access the additional settings select the option "Edit Details". This is shown both above your dashboard as well as next to the title at the bottom.

After selecting this button you will now see the option to show your sheet as tabs. Once ticked, this will reveal all of the dashboard in your workbook.
