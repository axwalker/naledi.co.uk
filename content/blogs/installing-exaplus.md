Having started my new Dataschool placement with Exasol recently, one of my first goals was to familiarise myself with the product.

I am given access to the company Exasol database so I don’t need to install my own instance. If your company doesn’t use Exasol or you want to create your own database for personal use you can download the [Free Small Business Edition](https://www.exasol.com/portal/display/DOWNLOAD/Free+Trial) to store your own data.

Exaplus is the interface that sits on top of that database and allows you to interact with your data through SQL commands. It also supports several other programming languages such as python and R that enable you to analyse data directly in the database. You don't need Exaplus to use Exasol with Tableau and Alteryx but I find it helpful to have that direct insight into my data and be able to test if connections are working.

I downloaded Exaplus from the Exasol website to interact with the schema that had been set up for me. You can download your own, free Exaplus from the [downloads website](https://www.exasol.com/portal/display/DOWNLOAD/6.0). In the left pane you can select the newest version of Exasol, which at the moment is 6.0.0. Then, in the main view, scroll down to the list of latest downloads. The second item from the top is the 'Download Client' and you can see that the green file name is 'Exaplus-6...'. Have a close look at the file name to identify the correct version for your system. Then just download and follow the instructions throughout the installation process.
